* Solutions
This doesn't work in their editor, but it is the right concept.

#+begin_src sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(@N INT) RETURNS INT AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @n;
    SET @n= @N - 1;
    RETURN (
      IFNULL(
       (SELECT DISTINCT salary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET @n),
      NULL)
    );
END;
#+end_src
